# Overview

This is a console-based hangman game. I wrote this program so that I could learn how to program in the C++ language. By doing so, I have learned the basic syntax and functionality of the C++ language.

The hangman game will start by drawing the hangman post and display underlines as a hint for the word that the user needs to guess. As the user makes guesses, the man will slowly appear as incorrect guesses are entered, and the word will slowly appear as correct guesses are entered. The user can also enter an entire word as their guess if they would like. When a game has ended, the program will ask the user if they would like to play again so that multiple games can be played in a row if desired.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used Visual Studio Code, C++, Git, and GitHub.

I used C++ as my programming language for this program.

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to do the following to this program:

- Make it so the user can add words that they would like to guess
- Add difficulty levels where the user has more or less incorrect guesses before they fail
- Make a score board that keeps track of words that were guessed with the least amount of mistakes
